# Intro to Programming II - Data Visualization

# Mar 2023 - Sep 2023

# Associated with University of London

This project was part of my Midterm and Final. During the second semester, we were given the choice to select one from three options: a drawing app, music visualization, or data visualization. I chose data visualization as I enjoy data-related projects. For this project, I had to use free datasets and visualize each of their data in an informative and graphical way using JavaScript and the p5 library. Before diving into the code, I planned it using rough notes, project logs, and kanban diagrams, and conducted research. After writing the code for visualization, I tested it for stability and usability.

**Note: Code written between Start and End comments is my own. The rest was provided by the University of London, and other code used has been credited.**
